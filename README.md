# Reservoir-Decimals
A Python program that combines loops, conditionals, and user input to solve multiple problems, including decimal tolerance checking, reservoir water level simulation, and Collatz sequence modeling. This project demonstrates input validation, arithmetic operations, and control flow through structured function-based design.

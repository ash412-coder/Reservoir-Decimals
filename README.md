# Reservoir-Decimals
A Python program that combines loops, conditionals, and user input to solve multiple problems, including decimal tolerance checking, reservoir water level simulation, and Collatz sequence modeling. This project demonstrates input validation, arithmetic operations, and control flow through structured function-based design.

How It Works
Each program uses:
Loops to repeat calculations or check conditions over time.
Conditional statements (if, elif, else) for logical branching.
Input validation to prevent invalid or unsafe entries.
Formatted output for clear results displayed to the user.

Concepts Shown
Python loops (while, for)
Conditional logic and comparison operators
Type casting and input handling
Arithmetic operations and control flow
Function-based program design
